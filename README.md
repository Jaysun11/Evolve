A Simplistic Evolution Simulator

# What is Evolve?
After working on a number of projects that somewhat 'banned' Swing and AWT gui components in java I took it upon myself to begin a small project to test the capabilities of these packages. Evolve is that project. 

Evolve is a very basic evolution simulator that creates 200 creatures with a very small chance of mutuating for the better (somewhat like natural selection) whenever the reproduce. 

Creatures have speed, age, size, digestion time (how optimally they digest food), lifespan and the ability the lay eggs which occurs at different times according to their lifetime and ability to lay more than one egg. Each of these stats have the ability to change with every generation of species. 

These 200 creatures have the ability to grow teeth and mutate into carnivores, carnivores have the ability to eat any other creature (smaller than themselves) for food. 

Food respawns approximately a third of a second after it has been eaten to ensure their is always approximately 300+ food in the world so creates don't die of starvation too regularly.
